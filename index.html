        <p>Karolina Protsenko is a violinist and a singer. She has a youtube channel where she posts all her videos of her singing, playing her violin and guitar. I also play my violin, but because of watching her videos i started to play my violin everyday and get better. She was my inspiration to playing my violin. Her inspiration was Lindsey Stirling.
            Karolina Protsenko is one out of the 3 children.<br /><br /> She has 2 brothers. Leo and Nicholas. Leo is 4-5 years old and Nicholas was born somewhere is March this year. Actually Her whole family comes from the boodline of playing instruments! Her mom plays the piano, her dad plays the hiutar, she plays the violin, guritar and sometimes sing. Her to small brother can't play anything yet because... well they are really young right now.</p>
